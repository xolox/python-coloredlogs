The `coloredlogs` package enables colored terminal output for Python's logging_
module. The ColoredFormatter_ class inherits from `logging.Formatter`_ and uses
`ANSI escape sequences`_ to render your logging messages in color. It uses only
standard colors so it should work on any UNIX terminal. It's currently tested
on Python 2.6, 2.7, 3.4, 3.5 and PyPy. On Windows `coloredlogs` automatically
pulls in Colorama_ as a dependency and enables ANSI escape sequence translation
using Colorama. Here is a screen shot of the demo that is printed when the
command ``coloredlogs --demo`` is executed:

Note that the screenshot above includes the custom logging level `VERBOSE`
defined by my verboselogs_ package: if you install both `coloredlogs` and
`verboselogs` it will Just Work (`verboselogs` is of course not required to use
`coloredlogs`).

Format of log messages
----------------------

The ColoredFormatter_ class supports user defined log formats so you can use
any log format you like. The default log format is as follows::

 %(asctime)s %(hostname)s %(name)s[%(process)d] %(levelname)s %(message)s

This log format results in the following output::

 2015-10-23 03:32:22 peter-macbook coloredlogs.demo[30462] DEBUG message with level 'debug'
 2015-10-23 03:32:23 peter-macbook coloredlogs.demo[30462] VERBOSE message with level 'verbose'
 2015-10-23 03:32:24 peter-macbook coloredlogs.demo[30462] INFO message with level 'info'
 ...

You can customize the log format and styling using environment variables as
well as programmatically, please refer to the `online documentation`_ for
details.

Usage
-----

Here's an example of how easy it is to get started:

.. code-block:: python

   # create a logger object.
   import logging
   logger = logging.getLogger('your-module')

   # initialize coloredlogs.
   import coloredlogs
   
   coloredlogs.install(logger=logger, level='DEBUG') # will print logs only from your code
   # coloredlogs.install(level='DEBUG')  # will print logs from libraries too - install handler into the root logger

   # some examples
   logger.debug("this is a debugging message")
   logger.info("this is an informational message")
   logger.warn("this is a warning message")
   logger.error("this is an error message")
   logger.critical("this is a critical message")

Colored output from cron
------------------------

When `coloredlogs` is used in a cron_ job, the output that's e-mailed to you by
cron won't contain any ANSI escape sequences because `coloredlogs` realizes
that it's not attached to an interactive terminal. If you'd like to have colors
e-mailed to you by cron there's a simple way to set it up::

    MAILTO="your-email-address@here"
    CONTENT_TYPE="text/html"
    * * * * * root coloredlogs --to-html your-command

The ``coloredlogs`` program is installed when you install the `coloredlogs`
package. When you execute ``coloredlogs --to-html your-command`` it runs
``your-command`` under the external program ``script`` (you need to have this
installed). This makes ``your-command`` think that it's attached to an
interactive terminal which means it will output ANSI escape sequences which
will then be converted to HTML by the ``coloredlogs`` program. Yes, this is a
bit convoluted, but it works great :-)

You can use this feature without using `coloredlogs` in your Python modules,
but please note that only normal text, bold text and text with one of the
foreground colors black, red, green, yellow, blue, magenta, cyan and white
(these are the portable ANSI color codes) are supported.
