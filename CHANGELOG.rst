`Release 15.1`_ (2023-04-25)
----------------------------

Enable use with Python version 3.9 - 3.12: path for site-packages is found via
sysconfig instead of distutils.

`Release 15.0.1`_ (2021-06-11)
------------------------------

Bug fix: Restore :class:`.StandardErrorHandler` functionality

The :class:`.StandardErrorHandler` class is responsible for dynamically
resolving (looking up the value of) sys.stderr for each logged message instead
of once when :func:`coloredlogs.install()` is called.

This was unintentionally broken by changes in `release 14.1`_.

.. _Release 15.0.1: https://github.com/xolox/python-coloredlogs/compare/15.0...15.0.1

`Release 15.0`_ (2020-12-10)
----------------------------

Don't enable system logging on MacOS and Windows anymore.

This is backwards incompatible (which is why I'm bumping the major version
number) however the old behavior has been reported to be rather problematic
(see :func:`~coloredlogs.syslog.is_syslog_supported()` for details) so this
seems like the best choice.

.. _Release 15.0: https://github.com/xolox/python-coloredlogs/compare/14.2...15.0

`Release 14.3`_ (2020-12-10)
----------------------------

Merged pull request `#89`_ which enhances :func:`coloredlogs.install()` to
preserve the filters on handlers that are replaced by :pypi:`coloredlogs`.

.. _Release 14.3: https://github.com/xolox/python-coloredlogs/compare/14.2...14.3
.. _#89: https://github.com/xolox/python-coloredlogs/pull/89

`Release 14.2`_ (2020-12-10)
----------------------------

Honor the ``$NO_COLOR`` environment variable as suggested in issue `#88`_.

.. _Release 14.2: https://github.com/xolox/python-coloredlogs/compare/14.1...14.2
.. _#88: https://github.com/xolox/python-coloredlogs/issues/88

`Release 14.1`_ (2020-12-10)
----------------------------

**Bug fixes:**

- Don't allow interactive terminal detection to disable colored text when
  colored text is being forced by the caller (reported in issue `#84`_).

- Automatically disable colored text when logging output is being redirected to
  a file in such a way that it actually works ðŸ˜¬ (reported in issue `#100`_).

**Other changes:**

- Start testing on PyPy 3 (because why not?)

`Release 14.0`_ (2020-02-16)
----------------------------

Integrate native Windows 10 support for ANSI escape sequences (`#71`_, `#72`_).

Native support for ANSI escape sequences was added to Windows 10 after its
initial release, specifically in release 10.0.14393. I've now updated
:pypi:`coloredlogs` and :pypi:`humanfriendly` to detect and enable this "new"
native support.

Windows 10 seems to comprise the majority of Windows installations worldwide so
in the interest of "looking forward" I've decided to drop the :pypi:`colorama`
requirement, given that it has now become a minority use case.

Hopefully most existing users will not experience any regression because they
previously installed :pypi:`colorama` already, and when available it will still
be used. However new installations on older Windows systems now require users
to install :pypi:`colorama` separately. This has been documented in the readme
in an attempt to minimize resulting confusion.

PS. In case anyone is wondering: I decided that giving a major Windows support
update in :pypi:`coloredlogs` the version 13.0 was asking for trouble, so I
decided not to do that ðŸ˜‡.

.. _#72: https://github.com/xolox/python-coloredlogs/pull/72

`Release 12.0`_ (2020-02-16)
----------------------------

Two backwards incompatible changes prompted another major version bump:

- Merged pull request `#80`_ that drops support for Python 3.4 which
  has gone end-of-life and now represents less than 1% of PyPI downloads.

- Improved compatibility with the Python standard library by changing
  the order of positional arguments received by the initializer of the
  :class:`~coloredlogs.ColoredFormatter` class (as suggested in `#64`_
  and `#75`_).

.. _#75: https://github.com/xolox/python-coloredlogs/issues/75

`Release 11.3`_ (2020-02-15)
----------------------------

- Add support for the ``%(username)s`` field (requested in `#76`_) and properly
  document supported custom fields.

- Consistently use ``console`` highlighting in documentation.

- Fix a broken link in the readme.

.. _Release 11.3: https://github.com/xolox/python-coloredlogs/compare/11.2...11.3
.. _#76: https://github.com/xolox/python-coloredlogs/issues/76

`Release 11.2`_ (2020-02-15)
----------------------------

Merge pull request `#79`_ which adds support for Python 3.8.

.. _Release 11.2: https://github.com/xolox/python-coloredlogs/compare/11.1...11.2
.. _#79: https://github.com/xolox/python-coloredlogs/pull/79

`Release 11.1`_ (2020-02-15)
----------------------------

Starting with the previous release I've resolved to try and tackle the large
number of open issues after an unplanned hiatus from the development and
maintenance of my open source projects, so here are some more bug fixes:

- Fix support for custom log record factories and add a test to avoid
  regressions (`#47`_, `#59`_).

- Change ``make screenshots`` to be Python 3 compatible and document
  additional requirements (`#65`_).

.. _Release 11.1: https://github.com/xolox/python-coloredlogs/compare/11.0...11.1
.. _#59: https://github.com/xolox/python-coloredlogs/issues/59
.. _#65: https://github.com/xolox/python-coloredlogs/issues/65

`Release 11.0`_ (2020-02-14)
----------------------------

This is a maintenance release that drops Python 2.6 support, adds Python 3.7
support and merges quite a few minor pull requests. The major version number
was bumped because of the compatibility changes.

**Merged pull requests:**

- `#58`_: Don't import :mod:`coloredlogs` if ``$COLOREDLOGS_AUTO_INSTALL`` is
  set but empty.

- `#60`_: Fix :pypi:`flake8` messages to help stabilize Travis CI builds.

- `#61`_: Drop support for Python 2.6 to help stabilize Travis CI builds.

- `#62`_: Use SVG badge in README for consistency.

- `#69`_: Handle negative-offset timezones in tests.

- `#70`_: Use :func:`subprocess.check_call()` in the test suite to ensure that
  external commands succeed.

- `#74`_: Fix :exc:`~exceptions.TypeError` on MacOS on Python 3 in the
  :mod:`~coloredlogs.converter` module.

**Other changes:**

- Start testing on Python 3.7 (and document compatibility).
- Workaround Python 3.7 regression in test suite.
- Update ``Makefile`` to use Python 3 for local development.
- Merge MacOS on Travis CI fixes from :pypi:`humanfriendly`.

`Release 10.0`_ (2018-05-13)
----------------------------

Proper format string parsing, support for ``style='{'`` (`#11`_, `#17`_, `#52`_).

Until now coloredlogs has required differently colored fields in logging format
strings to be delimited by whitespace, leading to various issues:

- Back in December 2015 issue `#11`_ was reported by someone who had expected
  to be able to style fields without whitespace in between differently.

- Until `#52`_ was merged (released as 9.2 in April 2018) any whitespace would
  be collapsed to a single space, simply as a side effect of splitting on
  whitespace.

- This implementation was so naive that it didn't support whitespace as a
  padding character in ``%()`` formatting directives, because it wasn't able to
  distinguish formatting directives from surrounding text.

In order to properly fix `#11`_ I'm now introducing a very different approach
that does distinguish formatting directives from their surrounding text, which
means whitespace is no longer required. However in order to reduce the
conceptual incompatibilities between the old versus new approach whitespace is
still significant, as follows:

1. First the logging format string is separated into formatting directives
   versus surrounding text (which means whitespace used as a padding character
   in a ``%()`` formatting directive is considered to be part of the formatting
   directive, as it should).

2. Then formatting directives and surrounding text are grouped based on
   whitespace delimiters (in the surrounding text).

3. For each group styling is selected as follows:

   1. If the group contains a single formatting directive that has a style
      defined then the whole group is styled accordingly. This is the behavior
      which provides (some level of) conceptual backwards compatibility.

   2. If the group contains multiple formatting directives that have styles
      defined then each formatting directive is styled individually and
      surrounding text isn't styled (this behavior is backwards incompatible
      but arguably an improvement over the old behavior).

While I was working on the improved format string parsing I figured it was
easiest to include support for ``style='{'`` (requested in `#17`_) from the
start in the new implementation, given that I was redoing the affected code
anyway.

`Release 9.3.1`_ (2018-04-30)
-----------------------------

Bug fix: Restore MacOS compatibility after publishing release 9.3.

The following build failure became apparent to me just minutes after
publishing release 9.3 so I decided to change the implementation:
https://travis-ci.org/xolox/python-coloredlogs/jobs/372806733

.. _Release 9.3.1: https://github.com/xolox/python-coloredlogs/compare/9.3...9.3.1

`Release 9.3`_ (2018-04-29)
---------------------------

Enable flexible millisecond formatting using the ``%f`` directive (`#45`_).

.. _Release 9.3: https://github.com/xolox/python-coloredlogs/compare/9.2...9.3
.. _#45: https://github.com/xolox/python-coloredlogs/issues/45

`Release 9.2`_ (2018-04-27)
---------------------------

- Merged pull request `#47`_: Switch to ``logging.getLogRecordFactory()``. In
  the merge commit I added a small performance enhancement by checking for the
  existence of ``logging.getLogRecordFactory()`` just once, when a
  ``ColoredFormatter`` object is instantiated.

- Merged pull request `#52`_: Don't change whitespace in format strings. In the
  merge commit I promoted the inline function to an instance method so that it
  can be reused by sub classes of ``ColoredFormatter``.

.. _#47: https://github.com/xolox/python-coloredlogs/pull/47
.. _#52: https://github.com/xolox/python-coloredlogs/pull/52

`Release 9.1`_ (2018-04-26)
---------------------------

- Added ``license`` key to ``setup.py`` script (`#53`_).
- Added this changelog (requested in `#55`_).

.. _Release 9.1: https://github.com/xolox/python-coloredlogs/compare/9.0...9.1
.. _#53: https://github.com/xolox/python-coloredlogs/pull/53
.. _#55: https://github.com/xolox/python-coloredlogs/issues/55

`Release 9.0`_ (2018-01-17)
---------------------------

Added support for background colors and 256 color mode (`#35`_).

Most of the changes required for this were actually implemented in the
humanfriendly_ package (see issue `#35`_). The changes in coloredlogs
are mostly related to the ANSI to HTML conversion.

One unrelated change was made, that was to use faint green for the ``SPAM`` log
level (to distinguish it from ``DEBUG``).

New features in ANSI to HTML conversion:

- Support for bright and faint colors.
- Support for underlined, strike-through and inverse text styles.

Bug fixes in ANSI to HTML conversion:

- The scheme of URLs is no longer stripped from visible output.
- Support for ``\x1b[m`` as a short hand for ``\x1b[0m`` (I only learned about
  this today when I didn't understand the empty ANSI escape sequence at the end
  of each line emitted by ``hg log``).
- Ensure that the pattern for URLs doesn't capture ANSI sequences.

- Documenting how it all works. This will follow in the next commit
  which is going to be a rather big one (hence why I see some value
  in keeping it separate from the implementation changes).

Miscellaneous changes:

- Add installation instructions to readme.
- Improve screenshots in documentation.
- Automate taking of screen shots :-).

`Release 8.0`_ (2018-01-05)
---------------------------

Set the default date format in a new ``formatTime()`` method (`#42`_).

I decided to bump the major version number because this change is technically
backwards incompatible, even though it concerns a minor detail (``datefmt``
being set to its default value in the initializer). Then again, this change
does improve compatibility with the behavior of the ``logging.Formatter`` class
in Python's standard library, so there's that :-).

.. _Release 8.0: https://github.com/xolox/python-coloredlogs/compare/7.3.3...8.0
.. _#42: https://github.com/xolox/python-coloredlogs/pull/42

`Release 7.3.3`_ (2018-01-05)
-----------------------------

Bug fix for ``coloredlogs --demo`` so that it always displays the ``DEBUG`` message (`#41`_).

.. _Release 7.3.3: https://github.com/xolox/python-coloredlogs/compare/7.3.2...7.3.3
.. _#41: https://github.com/xolox/python-coloredlogs/pull/41

`Release 7.3.2`_ (2018-01-05)
-----------------------------

Bug fixes and improvements to ANSI to HTML conversion:

-----------------------------

Bug fix for ``get_install_requires()`` in ``setup.py`` script (fixes `#43`_).

.. _Release 7.3.1: https://github.com/xolox/python-coloredlogs/compare/7.3...7.3.1
.. _#43: https://github.com/xolox/python-coloredlogs/issues/43

`Release 7.3`_ (2017-08-07)
---------------------------

Added support for the ``SUCCESS`` log level (related to `#27`_ and `verboselogs
issue #4 <https://github.com/xolox/python-verboselogs/issues/4>`_).

.. _Release 7.3: https://github.com/xolox/python-coloredlogs/compare/7.2...7.3
.. _#27: https://github.com/xolox/python-coloredlogs/issues/27

`Release 7.2`_ (2017-08-07)
---------------------------

Merged pull requests `#34`_, `#37`_ and `#38`_:

- Include the files needed to generate the Sphinx documentation in source distributions published to PyPI (`#34`_).
- Improve documentation by removing usage of deprecated ``logger.warn()`` function (`#37`_).
- Improve documentation by using module ``__name__`` variable for logger name (`#38`_).

---------------------------

Make it easy to output milliseconds and improve documentation on this (`#16`_).

.. _Release 7.1: https://github.com/xolox/python-coloredlogs/compare/7.0.1...7.1
.. _#16: https://github.com/xolox/python-coloredlogs/issues/16

`Release 7.0.1`_ (2017-07-15)
-----------------------------

Try to improve robustness during garbage collection (related to `#33`_).

.. _Release 7.0.1: https://github.com/xolox/python-coloredlogs/compare/7.0...7.0.1
.. _#33: https://github.com/xolox/python-coloredlogs/issues/33

`Release 7.0`_ (2017-05-18)
---------------------------

This release improves the robustness of ANSI to HTML conversion:

- Don't break ANSI to HTML conversion on output encoding errors.
- Gracefully handle unsupported colors in converter module.
- Make it even easier to integrate with ``cron``.
- Improved the HTML encoding of whitespace.
- Wrap generated HTML in ``<code>`` by default.
- Reduced the size of generated HTML (really CSS).
- Reduced internal duplication of constants.

.. _Release 7.0: https://github.com/xolox/python-coloredlogs/compare/6.4...7.0

`Release 6.4`_ (2017-05-17)
---------------------------

Mention ``colorama.init()`` in the documentation (fixes `#25`_).

.. _Release 6.4: https://github.com/xolox/python-coloredlogs/compare/6.3...6.4
.. _#25: https://github.com/xolox/python-coloredlogs/issues/25

`Release 6.3`_ (2017-05-17)
---------------------------

Bug fix: Avoid ``copy.copy()`` deadlocks (fixes `#29`_).

This was a rather obscure issue and I expect this not to to affect most users,
but the reported breakage was definitely not intended, so it was a bug I wanted
to fix.

.. _Release 6.3: https://github.com/xolox/python-coloredlogs/compare/6.2...6.3
.. _#29: https://github.com/xolox/python-coloredlogs/issues/29

`Release 6.2`_ (2017-05-17)
---------------------------

Enable runtime patching of ``sys.stderr`` (related to `#30`_ and `#31`_).

.. _Release 6.2: https://github.com/xolox/python-coloredlogs/compare/6.1...6.2
.. _#30: https://github.com/xolox/python-coloredlogs/issues/30
.. _#31: https://github.com/xolox/python-coloredlogs/pull/31

`Release 6.1`_ (2017-04-17)
---------------------------

- Bug fix: Adjust logger level in ``set_level()``, ``increase_verbosity()``, etc. (this is a follow up to release 6.0).
- Bug fix: Never enable system logging on Windows.
- Increase test coverage (using mocking).
- Document Python 3.6 support.

.. _Release 6.1: https://github.com/xolox/python-coloredlogs/compare/6.0...6.1

`Release 6.0`_ (2017-03-10)
---------------------------

Two backwards incompatible changes were made:

- Changed log level handling in ``coloredlogs.install()``.
- Changed the default system logging level from ``DEBUG`` to ``INFO``. To make
  it easier to restore the old behavior, ``coloredlogs.install(syslog='debug')``
  is now supported.

The old and problematic behavior was as follows:

- ``coloredlogs.install()`` would unconditionally change the log level of the
  root logger to ``logging.NOTSET`` (changing it from the root logger's default
  level ``logging.WARNING``) and the log levels of handler(s) would control
  which log messages were actually emitted.

- ``enable_system_logging()`` would never change the root logger's log level,
  which meant that when ``enable_system_logging()`` was used in isolation from
  ``install()`` the default log level would implicitly be set to
  ``logging.WARNING`` (the default log level of the root logger).

Over the years I've gotten a lot of feedback about the log level handling in
the coloredlogs package, it was clearly the number one cause of confusion for
users. Here are some examples:

- https://github.com/xolox/python-coloredlogs/issues/14
- https://github.com/xolox/python-coloredlogs/issues/18
- https://github.com/xolox/python-coloredlogs/pull/21
- https://github.com/xolox/python-coloredlogs/pull/23
- https://github.com/xolox/python-coloredlogs/issues/24

My hope is that with the changes I've made in the past days, the experience for
new users will be more 'Do What I Mean' and less 'What The Fuck is Going On
Here?!' :-). Of course only time (and feedback, or lack thereof) will tell
whether I've succeeded.

.. _Release 6.0: https://github.com/xolox/python-coloredlogs/compare/5.2...6.0

`Release 5.2`_ (2016-11-01)
---------------------------

Merged pull request `#19`_: Automatically call ``coloredlogs.install()`` if
``COLOREDLOGS_AUTO_INSTALL=true``.

While merging this pull request and writing tests for it I changed
the implementation quite a bit from the original pull request:

- The environment variable was renamed from ``COLOREDLOGS_AUTOUSE`` to
  ``COLOREDLOGS_AUTO_INSTALL`` (in order to make it consistent with the other
  environment variables) and added to the documentation.

- The ``coloredlogs.pth`` file was changed in order to reduce the amount of
  code required inside the ``*.pth`` file as much as possible and create room
  to grow this feature if required, by extending ``auto_install()``. I
  seriously dislike writing out complex code in a single line, especially when
  dealing with Python code :-).

- The ``coloredlogs.pth`` file has been added to ``MANIFEST.in`` to make sure
  that ``python setup.py sdist`` copies the ``*.pth`` file into the source
  distribution archives published to PyPI.

- The ``setup.py`` script was changed to figure out the location of the
  ``lib/pythonX.Y/site-packages`` directory using distutils instead of 'hard
  coding' the site-packages name (which I dislike for various reasons).

- The ``setup.py`` script was changed to preserve compatibility with universal
  wheel distributions using what looks like an undocumented hack found through
  trial and error (the other hacks I found were much worse :-). I ran into this
  incompatibility when running the tests under ``tox``, which runs ``pip
  install`` under the hood, which in turn runs ``python setup.py bdist_wheel``
  under the hood to enable wheel caching.

Bug fix: Don't use bold font on Windows (follow up to previous change).

.. _Release 3.1.4: https://github.com/xolox/python-coloredlogs/compare/3.1.3...3.1.4

`Release 3.1.3`_ (2015-10-27)
-----------------------------

Bug fix: Don't use bold font on Windows (not supported). For future reference,
I found this issue here: https://ci.appveyor.com/project/xolox/pip-accel/build/1.0.15

.. _Release 3.1.3: https://github.com/xolox/python-coloredlogs/compare/3.1.2...3.1.3

`Release 3.1.2`_ (2015-10-24)
-----------------------------

Bug fix for log format colorization (fixes `#9`_).

Rationale: I'm not validating the format, I just want to extract the referenced
field names, so looking for ``%(..)`` without a trailing type specifier (and
optional modifiers) is fine here.

.. _Release 3.1.2: https://github.com/xolox/python-coloredlogs/compare/3.1.1...3.1.2
.. _#9: https://github.com/xolox/python-coloredlogs/issues/9

`Release 3.1.1`_ (2015-10-23)
-----------------------------

Fixed broken Colorama reference in ``README.rst`` because it breaks the reStructuredText rendering on PyPI.

.. _Release 3.1.1: https://github.com/xolox/python-coloredlogs/compare/3.1...3.1.1

`Release 3.1`_ (2015-10-23)
---------------------------

Depend on and use Colorama on Windows (as suggested in `#2`_). I can't actually
test this because I don't have access to a Windows system, but I guess some day
someone will complain if this doesn't work as intended ;-).

.. _Release 3.1: https://github.com/xolox/python-coloredlogs/compare/3.0...3.1
.. _#2: https://github.com/xolox/python-coloredlogs/issues/2

`Release 3.0`_ (2015-10-23)
---------------------------

Major rewrite: Added ``ColoredFormatter``, deprecated ``ColoredStreamHandler``.

- Fixed `#2`_ by switching from ``connected_to_terminal()`` to
  ``terminal_supports_colors()`` (the latter understands enough about Windows
  to know it doesn't support ANSI escape sequences).

- Fixed `#6`_ by adding support for user defined formats (even using a custom
  filter to enable the use of ``%(hostname)s`` :-).

- Fixed `#7`_ by adding support for user defined formats and making
  ``coloredlogs.install()`` an almost equivalent of ``logging.basicConfig()``.

This rewrite mostly resolves `pip-accel issue #59
<https://github.com/paylogic/pip-accel/issues/59>`_. Basically all that's
missing is a configuration option in pip-accel to make it easier to customize
the log format, although that can now be done by setting
``$COLOREDLOGS_LOG_FORMAT``.
